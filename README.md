quelcom v0.4.0

quelcom is a set of tools to manage wav and mp3 files.
this release 0.4.0 is considered yet in beta state although works reasonably well for his author.

currently the following applications are implemented:
qwavinfo: to get info from a wav file
qwavjoin: to join two or more wav files in one
qwavcut: to extract or delete a fragment of a wav file
qwavsilence: to detect silence sequences in wav files
qwavfade: to fade in/out wav files
qwavheaderdump: to dump and fix wav headers

qmp3info: to get info from a mp3 file
qmp3join: to join two or more mp3 files in one
qmp3cut: to extract or delete a fragment of a mp3 file
qmp3check: to check and clean mp3 streams
qmp3report: to get reports from mp3 directory hierarchies

an info manual can be found in the doc subdir (html version and source texinfo is also available)
deprecated (version 0.3.0) man pages for each app are provided with the package

see INSTALL file for instructions about building and installing the software

enjoy it.
comments and suggestions are welcome.
