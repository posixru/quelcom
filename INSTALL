installation instructions for quelcom 0.4.0


REQUIREMENTS

quelcom is being developed on an intel p133 with suse 6.3 linux. other 
  configurations may work also.

a c++ compiler is needed. i'm currently using gcc 2.95.2.
c++ libraries: libstdc++ is required.


BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

the sources may be found at http://www.etse.urv.es/~dmanye/quelcom/quelcom.html
unpack the package:
	tar xzf quelcom-0.4.0.tar.gz
this should create a directory called quelcom-0.4.0 and expand there all the 
  files

get into the directory and build
	cd quelcom-0.4.0
	make
if you get any irrecoverable error, you can try to fix it by editing by hand 
  the makefile, or looking at the source files ;-). otherwise you can try to 
  contact with me and explain me what kind of error you get.

when everything is fine you can proceed with installation issuing the command:
	make install

by default places of installation are:
	- /usr/local/bin: executables
	- /usr/local/lib: libraries
        - /usr/local/share/locale: translation files
	- /usr/local/info: info manual 

you can change this by editing the root makefile and changing the predefined 
  values to your preferences.

the doc directory contains also the info manual in html and txt formats.

in addition, this release also contains the deprecated man pages for version 
0.3.0. they will be installed under /usr/local/man if you issue the command 
'make installman'.



  

gaudeix-ne, si pots.
